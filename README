## DP curve segment

The notebook shows how to generate a synthetic data and then segment is using
DP. DP will find the segments that best fit the curve to a various candiate
curves (in this example, linear and exp curves). The turning points can then
be identified. 

The major application of this is to find exp/linear growth time period of
COVID-19 cases in US.
